  "body": "As the title implies, this blog is a repository for all of my thoughts on beat-driven music. It could be anything from writing about a certain sound, a certain genre, a certain scene, from a certain era or an artist's oeuvre. Through articles, playlists and showcase mixes, The Next Groove serves as an outlet to share music. And to reflect about said music. To try and understand where it's going, what it currently is and where it's comes from.\n\nUnderground electronic music from all over has always been obsessed with forward momentum, and has made itself go through stylistic shifts, ruptures and resurgences; conforming to the broader musical landscape in which it lives, but also reacting against it. As the lone writer of this site, I'll try and do my part in making sense of it. \n\nAs you may have noticed, most of the music I talk about is electronic (House, Techno, DnB, Dubstep, and everything in-between). And while that encompasses a colossal amount of music to listen and discover, I won't limit myself to it, and I'd take certain occasions to talk about other genres like Dancehall, Hip Hop, Jazz, RnB, etc. As listener, I never dwell on one thing for too long, always moving on to the next thing in discovering and re-discovering the old and the new. \n\nWhich is why I thought The Next Groove to be an apt title for this blog.\n\nPatrick"
