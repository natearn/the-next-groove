  "body": "Consider this statement: \"Jungle has House influences\".\n\nYou say: \"Ok...\"\n\nThe interlocutor continues: \"Jungle also has Techno influences.\"\n\nYou pause for a slight moment, and agree.\n\nAnd you're left wondering: What is House? What, exactly, is Techno? And how can people distinguish one from the other so assuredly?\n\nLet me try and give a description. Techno is machine music. Usually instrumental, it has a steady, repetitive rhythm; it's not too slow, but not too fast. It can sound grey and atonal, or even, at times, bright and melodic. Created in the 80s in Detroit, it takes massive influences from West Coast P-Funk and 70s German electronic music, taking the German motorik pulse and putting it in a dance/club environment."
