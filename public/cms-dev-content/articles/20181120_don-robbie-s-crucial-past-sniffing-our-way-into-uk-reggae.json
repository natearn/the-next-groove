  "summary": "If the Youtube comment sections are to be believed, Robbie owns everything now. ",
  "body": "And Robbie is always there to document it. Not only those \"characters\", but also to get the opinion of other \"more sensible, reasonable\" fans. His work has earned him over 800k subscribers, making his channel by far the biggest football/soccer fan channel on Youtube. His channel has caught the attention of professional pundits such as Gary Neville (who's also appeared on the channel) and he's been invited to talk on TV and on other Youtube channels.\n\nAnd if the Youtube comment sections are to be believed, Robbie owns everything now. Every stadium, every building, every parc, every monument (from whichever country) that are used as backdrops for his videos are apparently his. Really, it's just a playful way to express how much success he's had. That's why he's the Don. Don Robbie.\n\nHowever, about a year ago, someone unearthed some old concert footage featuring a familiar face. Well, it appears that before Don Robbie, in his days of yore, he was the reggae artist, the badman, the rudebwoy, the sound murderer, Crucial Robbie."
