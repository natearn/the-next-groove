So with a genre like dubstep, there \\[were] DJs like Youngsta and Hatcha, who both produced occasional records, but were essentially specialist DJs. And they put a lot of initially quite disparate music into context as being one thing. And it was that which really honed the sound and made it what it was. It helped people identify with it, I think. It made the music less impenetrable.\"_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"RIGHT\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\- Ben UFO, Red Bull Music Academy Lecture, 2014\n\nLet's go back 15 years.  If you were living in London, you might have been able to pick up the signal from the then-pirate radio station, Rinse FM, at home or in your car. And you might have caught DJ Hatcha's show. You listen closely. The music is dark and bassy. Energetic, earthy and esoteric. It's stripped back for the most part - the percussion and the rumbling bass - with minimal instrumentation put on top, usually a sample taken from whatever exotic/\"ethnic\"/oriental music. And you can faintly hear some 2-step Garage influences in the beat patterns, but the music has already begun to stray away from it.\n\nAnd on top you hear the playful and almost nonsensical chatter of MCs Crazy D (mostly) and Beezy.\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Come on Hatcha! Take them to the jungle! Come on do it! Don't just say it, DO IT!\"_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Deeper and darker we go! Big up all the one-blingers!\"_\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n_\"Going in with full stamina! Wa Wa oooeeee! Ongie Bongie!\"_\n\n![In the studio](/cms-dev-content/uploads/dubstepallstars02.jpg)\n\nFor everyone that was locked in to the show way back in 2003 - from the \"deep heads\" recording the set on cassette, to the likes of the Digital Mystikz, smoking a spliff in their car - listening to Hatcha's selection of underground bass music, that he and Crazy D would call \"Tribal\" or \"Ongie bongie\", what they probably didn't know was that they were listening to the early renditions of what would soon be called Dubstep.\n\nAs Ben UFO (founder of Hessle Audio, one of the most celebrated underground UK labels) says in the above quote, Hatcha was a specialist, honing into a particular sound. In the early 2000s, a whole bunch of producers and DJs, with backgrounds in UK Garage, started making darker, rawer beats at 140 bpm, often with stylistic influences taken from the darker ends of Jungle and Drum n Bass. In 2003, 15 years ago, Dubstep and Grime hadn't yet crystallized into defined genres.  There were different styles going about within the \"140 sound\" diaspora; from the breakstep garage sound, to dark garage Ã  la DJ Narrows, to sublow, eski beat and dubstep. The Dubstep (dubby 2-step garage) term, from what I understand, was initially used to describe Horsepower Productions' output and all of the  music influenced by it, or which resembled it."
