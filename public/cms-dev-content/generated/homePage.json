Discouraged by the direction the genre had taken, he started his new label in order to push a sound that aligned itself more with his tastes. The first few releases - notably from Kryptic Minds - are characterized by a return to Dubstep's \"roots\" (the noisy, aggressive sound was overtaking the scene by then) : the dark and minimal, halftime style.\n\n![a big party](/cms-dev-content/uploads/wideimg.jpg)\n\nBut the label took a sudden turn in 2010 with its 5th release: Addison Groove's (aka Headhunter) 12\" record with Footcrab (and Dumbshit on the B-side). It became an immediate hit in the underground. The Juke-inspired, lo-fi, bassy, drum-machine track sounded like nothing else in Dubstep.\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Elzhi - February\" iframe={<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ZTcta21Dh0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen></iframe>} />","urlPath":"/article/20180926_test-title"}]}
