  "body": "I'd like to expand on my thoughts in the \"[What is the New Hardcore?](https://www.thenextgroove.site/article/20181104_what-is-the-new-hardcore)\" article - which ended with the \"_I don't know_\" remark - by reasserting two possible answers that I had given:\n\n> _**\"... Is it in the rolling, subbass-y beats of techno-meets-dubstep being pushed out by Kaizen, Livity Sound, Version, Timedance, etc? \\[...] Is it in the highly percussive, bassy works of labels like Nervous Horizon, Sans Absence? ...\"\n> **_\n\nThose two styles, I think, represent the Hardcore sound right now. And as is usual with new styles of music, they have no official names, as they are barely discernible scenes in the immense, ever-growing and constantly-morphing world of electronic music.\n\nThe first one is, in a practical sense, techno, but it's a \"UKifed\" version of  techno. Generally called \"bass\" and/or categorized as \"uk techno\", it's the continuation of the early sound of [South London-era Dubstep](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BEJG9L-n_tE) (circa 2003-5),to my ears. The most important labels in shaping this style are Swamp81, Livity Sound and Hessle Audio. Other labels pushing this sound include: Kaizen, Mistry, Timedance, Durkle Disco, Jelly Bean Farm, Artifice Music, Circular Jaw, etc, etc.\n\nThe second one is very percussive - almost tribal-like - with influences from UK Funky, Gqom and even Soca. On Soundcloud, most often than not, \"percussion bass\" and \"hard drum(s)\" tags are used to categorize the uploaded mixes and tracks. The most prominent labels are Nervous Horizon and Sans Absence.\n\nJust like Dubstep and Grime were once both part of the \"140 sound\" diaspora in the early 2000s (before becoming crystallized genres onto their own), so should \"UK Techno\" and \"Percussion Bass\" be considered as being part of the same \"bass\" diaspora of the current \"UK\" scene. I put \"UK\" in quotation marks because, although the sound still revolves around the UK soundsystem tradition of \"Hardcore\", people from all over the world practice it already.\n\nTypically around 120 to 130 bpm, the music is_ (sub)bassy_ and _percussively _inclined. What matters here is creating a rude, weighty groove - and that is the defining characteristic. A track's structure usually follows the conventions of Hardcore (as seen in Drum N Bass and Dubstep) - 1) an intro, 2) a drop, 3) a bridge and  4) a second drop.\n\nIt can be tribal and ostentatious, or meditative and moody (or anything in-between). It can put the drums at the forefront of the mix, or let the subbass breathe out.  It can be influenced by the thumping percussion of Gqom and Soca, the deep pulse of Techno, or the bass dread of early Dubstep. And when it comes to beat patterns, it can throw some Baltimore Club and Vogue in there too, for good measure. Like Jungle and Drum n Bass at their inception, it's a bastard sound, taking cues from everywhere, respective of current tastes.\n\nOk, but what does it sound like? Or, better put, what can it sound like? Remember, no formula is set in stone yet, so let's look at some examples...\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"NORMAL\" />\n\n♪\n\nFirst, a perfect example of  \"UK techno\": the duo **Silas and Snare**'s \"Biometric\" on the Manchester-based label Kaizen. Heavy and prominent syncopated kicks, a sliding subbass (like in old-school Dubstep), and Techno synths:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Silas & Snare - Biometric\" iframe={<iframe seamless=\"\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=1401239276/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=3423876283/transparent=true/\" style=\"border: 0; height: 120px; width: 100%;\"><a href=\"http://kaizenltd.bandcamp.com/album/biometric\">Biometric by Silas & Snare</a></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nSecond, a perfect example of \"Percussion Bass\" (or \"Hard Drums\"), this one from London-based label, Sans Absence. The label started out as a sort of UK Funky revival collective, but has been leaning towards this style in the last year. French producer **Noire **serves up the track \"2nd Guessin**'\"**, a monstruous, ravey, Soca-like percussive exercise:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Noire - 2nd Guessin'\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/401899980&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nHessle Audio co-founder, **Pearson Sound**, released a defining track two years ago, \"XLB\": snappy, syncopated drums and a rolling subbass in an huge build-up, with an immense mid-track drop:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Pearson Sound - XLB\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/265368071&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\n**Peverelist**, Livity Sound boss, who started his raving days as a Jungle head and his production career in Dubstep way back in 2007, made what is probably my favourite track from last year, \"Wireframes\": A dizzying, bouncing groove with an immense subbass. The Detroit Techno vibe in its second half brings it to another level:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Peverelist - Wireframe\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OO0bvOR1lWs?rel=0\" width=\"560\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\n**Ploy **comes up with some techy tribal sound, \"Ramos\", on the forward-thinking UK label, Timedance. \"Selecta!\":\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Ploy - Ramos\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/457729749&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nMontreal-based** Martin Bootyspoon**'s bass-heavy, menacing, Vogue-inspired beats can also be found in a UK Techno/Percussion Bass DJ's arsenal:\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Martyn Bootyspoon - Steam\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/399532338&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nSomeone like **Neana**, a member of the Night Slugs crew (another influential London label), might have a more \"neon-coloured\" take on the sound. This time, with \"Neans Anthem\": \n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Neana - Neans Anthem\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/392362911&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n\\---\n\nLastly, a track in this sound can also be more subdued, but still be endowed with that signature UK rudeness (i.e. a Dancehall and Hardcore influence, typical of UK sound system music ). Drum N Bass producer, **Henry Greenleaf**, dropping all the way down to around 125 bpm, does just that with \"In Same\":\n\n<EmbeddedMusic title=\"Henry Greenleaf - In Same\" iframe={<iframe allow=\"autoplay\" frameborder=\"no\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/476473071&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=true&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>} />\n\n<SpecialText align=\"CENTER\" size=\"undefined\" />\n\n♪\n\n## Further listening (links)\n\n[Fox - Big Man Ting (Meta Remix) (Unreleased)](https://soundcloud.com/metauk/fox-big-man-ting-meta-remix-kaizen-nts-rip)\n\n[Bash & T (Julio Basmore and T.Williams) - EC (2018, Conch Records)](https://conchrecords.bandcamp.com/track/ec)\n\n[Beneath - Special Offer (2018, Mistry)](https://mistrymuzik.bandcamp.com/track/special-offer)\n\n[Denham Audio & MC Serocee - Masta Blastah (2018, Durkle Disco)](https://durkledisco.bandcamp.com/track/masta-blastah-caski-remix)\n\n[Alex Coulton - Ambush (2016, Tempa)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHD0sFB-tHE)\n\n[Hodge - Light Wave (2017, Livity Sound)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyAFjRPPu_c)\n\n[Piezo - Keera (2017, Swamp81)](https://soundcloud.com/piezoofficial/keera)\n\n[Tessela - Glisten (2018, Whities)](https://whities.bandcamp.com/track/glisten)\n\n[Cousin - Ruff Draft (2016, Swamp81)](https://soundcloud.com/cousinofficial/ruff-draft)\n\n[Markee Ledge - Make Your Move (Addison Groove Remix), (2016, Skeleton)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru76j8sY88I)\n\n[Randomer & Hodge - Second Freeze (2016, Dnuos Ytivil)](https://livitysound.bandcamp.com/track/second-freeze)\n\n[Soreab - Bifle (Lamont Remix) (2018, Beat Machine Records)](https://soundcloud.com/hyponik-com/first-listen-soreab-bifle-lamont-remix)\n\n[Lava Dome - Closer (Galtier Remix) (2018)](https://soundcloud.com/hyponik-com/first-listen-lava-dome-closer-galtier-remix)\n\n[Jaymie Silk - Immersion (2018, Frite Nite)](https://soundcloud.com/seeksicksound/premiere-jaymie-silk-immersion-forthcoming-frite-nite)\n\n[Rushmore - Rolling O's (2018, Merge Layers)](https://soundcloud.com/mixmag-1/premiere-rushmore-rolling-os)"
